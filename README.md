## Overview

ez_scrape will be a library which helps users do some basic web scraping operations. Oftentimes when doing webscraping I rewrite code with slightly changed parameters to fit the website I scrape from. This library would be a tool that can scrape essentials from websites (tables, links, headers, etc.). I also plan on having the functionality to generate and traverse hyperlink trees.
